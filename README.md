#### Description:

#### A project intended to build out a full data pipeline for rich location/hourly weather metrics from 2005 - till the present day. The resulting Postres Database Data Warehouse can then be mined to discover and analyze on an ongoing basis.

##### Features:

- Utilizing Jupyter notebooks and the pandas python library to expolore, clean and transform datasets.
- Use Python to automate data cleaning and transformation using the unittest built-in module and also error logging utilizing the logging module.
- Harness the sqlite3 module within Python to access data from a relational database, and then produce an analytic ready data warehouse.
- Using Bash scripts to automate file management and run scripts.

##### Technologies:

1. Python and various standard library modules.
2. The Pandas and Numpy third-party packages.
3. Sqlite databases.
4. Knowledge of data cleaning and tidying.
5. Command Line and Bash Scripting.

##### Folder Structure:

Main Level: Includes the python, testing and bash scripts as well as the folders for the following:

- /logs - contains the logs for the testing and main production scripts.
- /data_dev - the repository for the main development database and csv file.
- /data_prod - the final location for the sqlite analytics database and csv file.

##### Running the Bash Script:

Not produced yet.
